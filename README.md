Pulse Gym Management is a full-stack Python web app that I designed and built as a solo project. The brief was to build a piece of software to help a local gym to manage memberships, fitness classes and bookings. The app was to allow the gym to:
- Create and edit members and fitness classes
- Book members onto classes
- View a list of all upcoming classes
- View all members that are booked in for a particular class

In addition, the app also has the functionality to:
- Set a maximum capacity for individual fitness classes; users can only be booked onto a class while there is space remaining.
- Enable gym staff to assign Premium or Standard membership to gym members. Standard members can only be signed up for classes during off-peak hours.
- Enable gym staff to mark members and classes as active or inactive. Inactive members and classes are not available when creating bookings.
- Check in members on arrival to pre-booked fitness classes.
